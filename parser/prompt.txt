Here is a code sample of the teddy language:
  enum Direction: Up, Right, Left, Down;
	// to retain a syntactical consistency the : denotes the begin of structured data, separated by commas,
	// while # separates a variable from its type
	struct SnekGame:
      apple #coordinate,
	  // read this as: an array of size boardsize containing an array of size boardsize containing bools
      snek #[boardsize; [boardsize; bool]],
      direction #Direction,
      head #coordinate,
      length #int,
	  // methods on structs have to be contained in impl blocks       
      impl:
          new:;#Self (
			SnekGame: 
				apple = coordinate::default(),
				head = coordinate::default(),
				snek = Array::new(boardsize, Array::new(boardsize, false)),
				length = 0,
				direction = Direction::Right
			;
          )
      ;
  ;
  And here is the EBNF grammar that is used to parse the teddy language into an AST:
  <programm> ::= <block>
  <block> ::= <declaration> | <statement>
  <declaration> ::= <import> | <enum> | <struct> | <trait> | <fn>
  <statement> ::= <assignment> | <return> | <if> | <match>
  <return> ::= "return" <expression>
  <fn> ::= <ident> ":" <param> ("," <param>)* "#" <type>
'
